Lately I’ve been working on some educational kits that I’m hoping to release soon. One important element for me is to be able to brand the products up so people know the kits are authentic circuitbeard. Originally I was just going to raster etch them, however this takes way too much time, so today I spent a bit of time creating vector versions of my logos to speed things up.

<div class="image" markdown="1">

</div>

With the new vector versions, it now takes just seconds to brand an item, rather than minutes. It may not sound like much, but when you are talking about creating lots of kits, every saving is a worth while saving (I’ve been learning this lesson a lot lately).

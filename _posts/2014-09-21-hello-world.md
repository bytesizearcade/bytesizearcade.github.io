As with any blog, it’s always tricky to know where to start, but I thought the best thing would be to setup some expectations.

In my day job, I work as an Umbraco developer, but if you have come here looking for blog posts on this subject, you will be better off looking over on [Outfield Digitals](http://outfield.digital) blog as that is where I do all my work related blogging.

This blog then is more about the things I do in my spare time, which usually involves electronics or making in varying senses of the word. I can’t promise that everything will be of the greatest quality as this is really just going to be somewhere I can keep track of the steps I took to get things working (I have a habit of jumping from platform to platform so often forget what I learn) but never the less, if you are into making and hacking, I hope you’ll find what I write interesting.
